MeteorGame
==========

This repository serves as a learning exercise for using the Meteor framework.

This project attempts to make some sort of game incorporating multiple players playing in somewhat realtime. 

So what does that mean? I'm not sure yet, but hold on and check back to see what becomes of it. Or pull it down and open some issues with your own thoughts.
